### About

#### How to

* Filter the data (options above) and the map and table will auto-update
* You can also select points using the movable/resizeable selection tool (click the broken rectangle button in the upper left of the map)
* You can also click rows of the datatable to highlight those points
* Zoom with the + and - buttons on the map (upper left), or with your mouse wheel
* Click markers to get information about that point

#### Purpose

* Mapping ([leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)) geolocation ([freegeoip](https://github.com/luiscape/freegeoip)) of artificially-generated IP addresses ([generator](https://github.com/paulhendricks/generator)) with arbitrarily-assigned colours and icons ([ionicons](http://ionicons.com/))
* Wrapping this into a user-friendly interface ([flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)) and including a table ([DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/))
* Allowing data selections to impact across both the map and table ([crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/))

*Note that none of these data are real. They've been randomly generated.*
